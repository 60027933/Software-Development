This repository is an assignment for the Software Development class, module 8, Exercise 3-2.

Hi! My name is Joseph Pack. I am a highschooler attending Southwest Technical College for software development. I participate with the local chess club and E-Sports team. I hope to one day become an Engineer or Programmer at a major firm.

I am taking this program in particular because I want to learn how to professionally develop software for my career and personal projects. I hope that through taking this program, I will become more comfortable with writing clean, bug-free, easy-to-maintain code in industry standard programming languages.
